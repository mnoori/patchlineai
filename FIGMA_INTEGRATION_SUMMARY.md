# Figma Integration Summary for Patchline AI

## ‚úÖ What We Successfully Built

### 1. **Core Integration Module** (`/lib/figma/`)
- ‚úÖ Figma API client with OAuth support
- ‚úÖ TypeScript type definitions
- ‚úÖ Token transformer (converts Figma tokens to brand format)
- ‚úÖ Component generator (generates React components from Figma)

### 2. **API Routes**
- ‚úÖ `/api/figma/showcase` - Serves Figma file data
- ‚úÖ `/api/figma/export` - Exports assets as images

### 3. **UI Components**
- ‚úÖ `FigmaShowcase` - Displays file overview, components, colors, and assets
- ‚úÖ `FigmaAssetPreview` - Interactive preview with export functionality
- ‚úÖ Background components using Figma data

### 4. **Scripts**
- ‚úÖ File exploration script
- ‚úÖ Asset testing script
- ‚úÖ Gradient extraction script

## ‚úÖ What Actually Works

### 1. **Asset Export** ‚úì
```javascript
// We can export any node as PNG/JPG/SVG
const imageUrl = await client.exportAssets(fileId, [nodeId], 'png', 2)
```
- **Logo Light**: Successfully exported
- **Brandmark Dark/Blue/Light**: Successfully exported
- **Brand Guide Frames**: Successfully exported
- All exportable assets now have Preview/Download buttons

### 2. **File Metadata** ‚úì
- File name, version, last modified date
- Node counts and types
- Component and style statistics

### 3. **Node Structure Analysis** ‚úì
- Full node tree traversal
- Finding specific nodes by ID or properties
- Extracting fills, effects, and properties

## ‚ùå Current Limitations

### 1. **Color Styles Issue**
- **Problem**: Figma API returns style type names ("Linear") instead of actual color values
- **Why**: These are gradient style references, not the gradients themselves
- **Solution**: We'd need to fetch the actual style definitions separately

### 2. **Gradient Background Extraction**
- **What we found**: The main Brand Guide frame has solid #121212 background
- **What you want**: The cyan-to-black gradient inside the slides
- **Issue**: The gradient is likely in a child element or applied as an effect

### 3. **Real-time Sync**
- Components and styles need manual refresh
- No webhook support for automatic updates

## üéØ What You Can Do Right Now

### 1. **View and Export Assets**
- Click "Preview" on any exportable asset in the Assets tab
- Download logos and brand marks directly
- All export URLs work and images display correctly

### 2. **Use Exported Images as Backgrounds**
```jsx
// Export the entire brand guide slide
const brandGuideUrl = "https://figma-alpha-api.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/..."

// Use it as a background
<div style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${brandGuideUrl})` }}>
  Your content here
</div>
```

### 3. **Extract Specific Gradients**
To get the gradient you want, we need to:
1. Find the specific inner frame/rectangle with the gradient
2. Extract its gradient stops
3. Generate CSS from those stops

## üöÄ Next Steps to Get Your Gradient

### Option 1: Export the Entire Slide
Since the Brand Guide frame (113:16) exports successfully, you can:
1. Use the exported PNG as a background image
2. This includes all visual elements exactly as designed

### Option 2: Find the Specific Gradient Element
I can create a script to:
1. Search inside the Brand Guide frame
2. Find all child elements with gradients
3. Export just those gradient rectangles

### Option 3: Manual Gradient Recreation
If you know the gradient colors:
```css
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #00D4FF 0%, #000000 100%);
```

## üìù The Truth About Figma API Capabilities

### Can Do ‚úÖ
- Export any frame/component as image (PNG, JPG, SVG)
- Get node properties (position, size, rotation, etc.)
- Extract solid colors and simple gradients
- Access component instances and overrides
- Get file structure and metadata

### Cannot Do ‚ùå
- Get meaningful names for color styles (API limitation)
- Directly access complex effects or blend modes
- Get text content with full styling
- Access private/unpublished components
- Real-time updates without polling

### Workarounds üîß
- Use image exports for complex designs
- Manually map style IDs to names
- Create a configuration file for gradients
- Use Figma plugins for advanced extraction

## üé® Your Specific Use Case

For your cyan-to-black gradient background:
1. **Current Status**: We found the frame but not the gradient layer
2. **Best Solution**: Export the full brand guide as PNG and use as background
3. **Alternative**: Manually recreate the gradient in CSS
4. **Future Enhancement**: Create a deeper search to find the exact gradient layer

Would you like me to:
1. Create a script to search deeper into the Brand Guide for gradient layers?
2. Show you how to use the exported brand guide image as a background?
3. Help you manually recreate the gradient in CSS?
