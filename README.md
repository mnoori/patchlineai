## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up environment variables in `.env.local`:
   ```
   REGION_AWS=us-east-1
   ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
   SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
   SOUNDCHARTS_APP_ID=your-soundcharts-id
   SOUNDCHARTS_API_KEY=your-soundcharts-key
   ```
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Configuration

Agents are configured in `agents.yaml` as the single source of truth:

```yaml
gmail:
  name: PatchlineEmailAgent
