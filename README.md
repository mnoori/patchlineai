## System Architecture

- **Gmail Agent**: Handles all email operations

- **Scout Agent**: Discovers and analyzes promising artists using Soundcharts data
- **Supervisor Agent**: Coordinates workflows between agents using the agent-as-tools pattern
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Server-Sent Events for live agent activity monitoring

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up environment variables in `.env.local`:
   ```
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
   SOUNDCHARTS_APP_ID=your-soundcharts-id
   SOUNDCHARTS_API_KEY=your-soundcharts-key
   ```
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Deploy AWS resources: `./scripts/deploy-all.ps1` (Windows) or see DEPLOYMENT.md

## Configuration

Agents are configured in `agents.yaml` as the single source of truth:

```yaml
gmail:
  name: PatchlineEmailAgent
  description: AI assistant for managing emails and communications
  model: claude-3-7-sonnet
  prompt: prompts/gmail-agent.md
  # ... more configuration

legal:
  name: PatchlineLegalAgent
  description: Legal AI assistant specialising in music contracts
  # ... more configuration

scout:
  name: PatchlineScoutAgent
  description: AI talent scout for discovering promising artists
  # ... more configuration

supervisor:
  name: PatchlineSupervisorAgent
  collaborators: [gmail, legal, scout]
  # ... more configuration
```

## User Personas

Patchline is designed for three key music industry personas:

1. **Creator**: Independent artists and producers managing their own careers
2. **Roster**: Labels, managers, and publishers handling multiple artists
3. **Enterprise**: Larger companies needing scalable insights and compliance

Each agent adapts its tone and recommendations based on the user's persona.

## API Integrations

### Soundcharts API
The Scout agent uses Soundcharts API for real-time artist data:
- Artist discovery and search
- Artist metadata (genre, biography, country)
- Career stage analysis
- Intelligent fallbacks for metrics not in free tier

Configure in your `.env.local`:
```
SOUNDCHARTS_APP_ID=PATCHLINE_A2F4F819
SOUNDCHARTS_API_KEY=d8e39c775adc8797
```
