---

## Week 1: Fix What's Broken (Make existing features work for labels)

### Day 1-2: Multi-Artist Support
**Why**: Labels manage multiple artists, not just their own music
**What**:
```typescript
// Add to settings page
- Artist picker/search
- Store multiple artist IDs
- Switch between artists in catalog
```

### Day 3-4: Email Templates for Labels
**Why**: Labels send the same emails repeatedly
**What**:
- A&R outreach template
- Contract negotiation template  
- Release announcement template
- Store in DynamoDB, accessible via Gmail Agent

### Day 5: Fix Platform Connections Display
**Why**: Looks broken when platforms show as disconnected
**What**:
- Fix the platform status indicators
- Add "Coming Soon" badges for unavailable platforms
- Make it clear what actually works

---

## Week 2: Connect the Money (Revenue features labels need)

### Day 6-8: Basic Streaming Analytics
**Why**: Labels need to see real numbers, not mock data
**What**:
```javascript
// Use Spotify API to get:
- Real streaming numbers
- Monthly listeners
- Revenue estimates (use standard rates)
- Store historical data
```

### Day 9-10: Contract ROI Tracking
**Why**: Labels need to justify their deals
**What**:
- Link contracts (from Legal Agent) to artists
- Track deal terms vs actual performance
- Simple ROI dashboard

---

## Week 3: Automation Wins (What labels will pay for)

### Day 11-13: Scout Agent Alerts
**Why**: Labels want to know when artists blow up
**What**:
- Daily email digest of watchlist changes
- Webhook for major milestones
- "Artists to Watch" weekly report

### Day 14-15: Release Coordination Workflow
**Why**: Launching music is complex and error-prone
**What**:
- Simple checklist system
- Automated reminder emails
- Connect to existing agents for tasks
