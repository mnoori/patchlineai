## The Billion-Dollar Problem We're Solving

Every day, millions of music professionals waste 60% of their time on repetitive tasks that kill creativity and cost the industry billions. Artists miss life-changing opportunities buried in overflowing inboxes. Managers burn out reviewing contracts they barely understand. Labels hemorrhage money on inefficient workflows. 

**The music industry loses $10 billion annually to operational inefficiency.**

Enter Patchline: the world's first AI agent platform built specifically for music professionals. We're not just another software tool - we're deploying an army of specialized AI agents that work 24/7 to handle the business so creators can focus on the art.
