ENABLE_S3=true
ENABLE_DYNAMODB=true
ENABLE_CLOUDWATCH=true

# Security Configuration
MCP_SECURITY_MODE=enforcing
MCP_RATE_LIMIT=60
MCP_BURST_LIMIT=10

# Performance Configuration
MAX_CONCURRENT_OPERATIONS=10
MCP_SESSION_TIMEOUT=300000
MCP_ENABLE_LOAD_BALANCING=true
```

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Streamable HTTP Transport
Following the AWS blog post recommendation, we implemented HTTP-based transport instead of stdio for enterprise deployment:

```typescript
const streamableConfig: StreamableHTTPConfig = {
  baseUrl: `https://bedrock-agent-runtime.${region}.amazonaws.com`,
  sessionManagement: true,
  authentication: { type: 'iam', config: { region } },
  scaling: {
    maxConcurrentSessions: 100,
    sessionTimeout: 300000,
    enableLoadBalancing: true,
  },
}
```

### 2. AWS Service Integration
Direct integration with AWS services using official SDKs:

```typescript
// Bedrock Knowledge Base Integration
const command = new RetrieveCommand({
  knowledgeBaseId: parameters.knowledgeBaseId,
  retrievalQuery: { text: parameters.query },
  retrievalConfiguration: {
    vectorSearchConfiguration: {
      numberOfResults: parameters.maxResults || 10,
    },
  },
})
```

### 3. Security Best Practices
Comprehensive security implementation with IAM integration:

```typescript
const securityPolicy: MCPSecurityPolicy = {
  rules: {
    allowedTools: ['music_knowledge_search', 'upload_audio_file'],
    resourceAccess: {
      s3Buckets: ['patchline-audio', 'patchline-artwork'],
      dynamoTables: ['artists', 'releases'],
      bedrockModels: ['anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0'],
    },
    rateLimit: { requestsPerMinute: 60, burstLimit: 10 },
  },
  enforcement: { mode: 'enforcing', logViolations: true },
}
```

### 4. Music Industry Context
Specialized tools and workflows for music industry use cases:

```typescript
async function analyzeArtistPerformance(artistId: string): Promise<TaskResult> {
  return this.executeTask(
    `Analyze performance metrics and trends for artist ${artistId}`,
    context,
    {
      artistId,
      includeStreaming: true,
      includeSocial: true,
      timeRange: '30d',
