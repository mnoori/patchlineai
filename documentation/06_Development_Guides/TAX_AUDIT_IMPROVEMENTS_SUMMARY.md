## Date: December 29, 2024

### Overview
This document summarizes all improvements made to the tax audit system to ensure IRS compliance and professional business operations positioning.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Gmail Receipt Processing Enhancement
- **Fixed Lyft Total Amount Extraction**: Now correctly captures the final total including taxes ($19.88 instead of $15.35)
- **Improved Date Parsing**: Fixed date extraction from email headers (e.g., "Wed, Dec 25, 2024 at 4:38 AM")
- **Better Vendor Detection**: Enhanced mapping for services like Lyft, Uber, CapCut, etc.

### 2. Amazon Receipt Processing
- **Multi-Order Support**: Now detects and processes multiple orders in a single email confirmation
- **Email-Based Processing**: Switched from PDF parsing to Gmail email prints for better accuracy
- **Product Name Extraction**: Fixed bug where product descriptions weren't being extracted properly
- **Actual Product Details**: Now extracts real product names like "Monoprice 16AWG Cable" instead of generic "Business Supplies"

### 3. Professional Business Context
The AI now understands your business context:
- **Entity**: Algoryx Art & Technology Lab (DBA Patchline AI)
- **Location**: Brooklyn studio (exclusively for business use)
- **Activities**: 
  - AI-powered music technology development
  - Live audiovisual performances
  - Content creation for social media
  - Professional networking events
  - Client meetings and demonstrations

### 4. IRS-Compliant Description Format
New format positions your business as a serious $10M technology enterprise:
```
[Category] - [Business Purpose] - [Specific Item/Service] - [Identifier]
```

Examples:
- "Office Expenses - Studio Infrastructure - Monoprice 16AWG Audio Cables - Order #114-3164790"
- "Advertising - Instagram Campaign - Robot Eye Technology Post - 547 Impressions - #229135"
- "Travel - Client Meeting Transportation - Manhattan to Brooklyn Studio - 2.84mi"

### 5. Smart Business Purpose Mapping
- **Party supplies** → "Event Marketing Materials" or "Client Development Materials"
- **Cables/Equipment** → "Studio Infrastructure"
- **Software** → "Content Production Tools"
- **Late night transportation** → "Transportation from [Event/Meeting] to Studio"
- **LED Balloons** → "Live Performance Production Materials"

### 6. Technical Improvements
- **120 Character Limit**: Prevents description truncation in UI
- **Better Model Selection**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4 as primary with fallback options
- **Fixed Product Loop Bug**: Added missing enumeration index for product extraction
- **Improved Prompt**: Explicitly instructs AI to use actual product names from receipts

### 7. Dual Receipt Processing System
- **Gmail Receipts**: For all non-Amazon email receipts
- **Amazon Receipts**: Specifically for Amazon orders (but still uses Gmail parser internally)
- Both maintain separate categories in the dropdown for better organization
