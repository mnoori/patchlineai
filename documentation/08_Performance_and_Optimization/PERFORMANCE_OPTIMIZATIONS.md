# Performance Optimizations Guide

## Summary of Optimizations Implemented

### 1. **Shared AWS DynamoDB Client** âœ…
- Created `lib/aws/shared-dynamodb-client.ts`
- Eliminates redundant AWS SDK initialization
- Single client instance reused across all API routes

### 2. **Aggressive In-Memory Caching** âœ…
- Implemented centralized cache in `lib/cache.ts`
- 5-minute TTL for all API responses
- Cache keys: `user:`, `platforms:`, `embeds:`, `embed:`
- Results: API responses reduced from 30-50s to <100ms for cached data

### 3. **Persistent Navigation Shell** âœ…
- Created `components/persistent-shell.tsx`
- Navbar and sidebar no longer remount on navigation
- Reduces unnecessary re-renders and API calls

### 4. **Route Pre-warming** âœ…
- Created `lib/route-prewarming.ts` and `components/route-prewarmer.tsx`
- Pre-fetches critical API routes on app startup
- Improves perceived performance for first interactions

### 5. **Next.js Dev Server Optimizations** âœ…
- **Turbopack support available** when Web3 is disabled
- Optimized webpack configuration for development
- Disabled CSS optimization in dev mode
- Added modularized imports for tree-shaking

### 6. **Performance Monitoring** âœ…
- Created `lib/performance-monitor.ts`
- Real-time performance dashboard (`components/performance-dashboard.tsx`)
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to toggle dashboard

### 7. **Web3 Feature Toggle** âœ… NEW!
- Made Web3/Dynamic Labs features toggleable
- Allows Turbopack usage when Web3 is disabled
- Easy to switch between modes

## How to Run the Optimized Dev Server

### Option 1: Turbo Mode (Fastest - 10-20x faster compilation) ðŸš€
Add this to your `.env.local` file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WEB3=false
```

Then run:
```bash
npx next dev --turbo
# Or
pnpm run dev:turbo
```

### Option 2: Regular Mode with Web3 Features
Add this to your `.env.local` file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WEB3=true
```

Then run:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

## About Turbo Mode

### Can Turbo be used in production?
**No**, Turbopack is currently only for development. In production, Next.js uses highly optimized webpack builds. But don't worry - production builds are already fast!

### Performance Differences:
- **Development with Turbopack**: 10-20x faster compilation
  - Initial compile: ~5-10s vs 50-80s
  - Hot reloads: <1s vs 5-10s
- **Production**: Both use optimized webpack builds (no difference)

### When to use each mode:
- **Use Turbo Mode** when:
  - You don't need Web3 features
  - You want fastest possible development
  - You're working on non-crypto features
  
- **Use Regular Mode** when:
  - You need Web3/Dynamic Labs features
  - You're working on crypto functionality
  - Performance is already good enough with caching

## Performance Results

### Before Optimizations:
- API calls: 30-50 seconds
- Tab switching: Complete app reload
- First page load: 30-50 seconds

### After Optimizations:
- **Cached API calls**: <100ms
- **First API calls**: 1-5 seconds  
- **Tab switching**: Instant (nav doesn't reload)
- **Dev compilation**: 
  - Regular mode: ~80s initial, reasonable hot reload
  - Turbo mode: ~5-10s initial, <1s hot reload

## Monitoring Performance

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the performance dashboard
2. Monitor API response times in real-time
3. Look for:
   - AVG: Average response time
   - P50: Median response time
   - P95: 95th percentile (worst case)

## Cache Management

Cache is automatically managed with 5-minute TTL. To manually clear cache:
- Restart the dev server
- Or wait 5 minutes for automatic expiry

## Next Steps for Production

1. Use production build: `pnpm build && pnpm start`
2. Enable CDN for static assets
3. Consider Redis for distributed caching
4. Add database connection pooling
5. Implement API response compression

## Troubleshooting

### Turbopack not working?
1. Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WEB3=false` in `.env.local`
2. Restart the dev server after changing env variables
3. Clear `.next` folder if needed: `rm -rf .next`

### Web3 features not working?
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WEB3=true` in `.env.local`
2. Use regular dev mode: `pnpm dev`
3. Restart the server after changing env variables

### If performance is still slow:
1. Check browser DevTools Network tab
2. Look for `[CACHE HIT]` vs `[CACHE MISS]` in terminal
3. Ensure you're not in production mode locally
4. Check for large bundle sizes in DevTools Coverage tab
