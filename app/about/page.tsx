                    Dr. Mehdi Noori is a rare hybrid of AI scientist and music industry insider. With a Ph.D. in
                    engineering, a postdoc at MIT, and 15+ years leading AI innovation at firms like AWS and Nielsen,
                    he's built scalable GenAI systems used by Fortune 500s across healthcare, finance, and media.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But he's also a trained music producer and DJ (ALGORYX). Formally educated at Point Blank, Sound
                    Collective, and Cosmic Academy, and deeply embedded in the creative scene. That dual fluency gives
                    him a unique edge: he's lived the pain points Patchline solves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before founding Patchline, Mehdi led the Algoryx Art & Tech Lab, where he prototyped AI-native tools
                    for creative workflows. Now, he's applying that experience to reimagine how music teams work: with
                    agentic infrastructure that blends deep technical rigor with human-centered design.

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 font-heading text-center">Our Story</h2>
              <div className="space-y-4 text-base">
                <p>
                  Patchline AI was born from a simple observation: music professionals spend too much time on repetitive
                  tasks and not enough time on creative work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During his time in both the AI and music industries, Dr. Noori experienced firsthand how
                  administrative work was draining creative energy from talented people. He saw how major labels had
                  access to sophisticated tools and teams that independent artists and smaller labels couldn't afford.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2024, he assembled a team of AI researchers and music industry veterans to explore how artificial
                  intelligence could democratize access to professional tools. They built the first prototype of the
                  Scout Agent to help A&R teams discover promising talent more efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The results were immediate: teams saved hours of manual work and discovered artists they would have
                  otherwise missed. This early success led to the development of our full suite of AI agents, each
                  designed to solve specific pain points in the music business.
