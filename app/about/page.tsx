                        Dr. Mehdi Noori is a rare hybrid of AI scientist and music industry insider. With a Ph.D. in
                        engineering, a postdoc at MIT, and 15+ years leading AI innovation at firms like AWS and Nielsen,
                        he's built scalable GenAI systems used by Fortune 500s across healthcare, finance, and media.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But he's also a trained music producer and DJ (ALGORYX). Formally educated at Point Blank, Sound
                        Collective, and Cosmic Academy, and deeply embedded in the creative scene. That dual fluency gives
                        him a unique edge: he's lived the pain points Patchline solves.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Before founding Patchline, Mehdi led the Algoryx Art & Tech Lab, where he prototyped AI-native tools
                        for creative workflows. Now, he's applying that experience to reimagine how music teams work: with
                        agentic infrastructure that blends deep technical rigor with human-centered design.

                    Patchline AI was born from a simple observation: music professionals spend too much time on repetitive
                    tasks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During his time in both the AI and music industries, Dr. Noori experienced firsthand how
                    administrative work was draining creative energy from talented people. He saw how major labels had
                    access to sophisticated tools and teams that independent artists and smaller labels couldn't afford.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2024, he set out to build something different: an AI platform that speaks the language of music, 
                    not just tech. Starting with deep research into how labels, artists, and music schools actually work, 
                    he began prototyping AI agents that could handle the repetitive tasks that steal time from creativity.

                  <p>
                    Today, Patchline AI is pioneering a new approach to music technology. Our vision is clear: give every 
                    music professional—from bedroom producers to established labels—access to AI tools that previously only 
                    tech giants could afford. We're not just building software; we're reimagining how the music industry 
                    can work when artificial intelligence handles the admin and humans focus on the art.
