# Spotify Artist Profile Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
The Spotify integration was showing the wrong artist profile (personal name instead of ALGORYX) because:
1. The system had hardcoded fallbacks to specific artist IDs
2. No proper user experience for configuring artist profiles
3. The wrong profile was being retrieved from Spotify's API

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Fallbacks ✅

**File: `app/api/spotify/artist-tracks/route.ts`**
- Removed hardcoded fallback to ALGORYX ID (`7ibWrazAoXwtMpiwDlpZ9k`)
- Now returns proper error when no artist profile is configured
- Added `needsSetup: true` flag in error responses

**File: `app/api/spotify/search-artist/route.ts`**
- Already had hardcoded mappings removed (empty `knownArtistIds` object)
- Prioritizes stored profiles from DynamoDB

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling ✅

**Changes Made:**
- Artist tracks API now returns meaningful errors when profile is missing
- Frontend properly handles setup requirements
- Clear user feedback when configuration is needed

### 3. Improved User Experience ✅

**File: `app/dashboard/catalog/page.tsx`**
- Added `needsArtistSetup` state to track when setup is required
- Added visual setup prompt with clear call-to-action
- Automatic dismissal when tracks load successfully
- Direct link to Settings page for configuration

**New UI Components:**
- Warning card with setup instructions
- "Configure Artist Profile" button
- Dismiss option for temporary hiding

### 4. Existing Infrastructure (Already Available) ✅

**Artist Profile Management:**
- API endpoints: `/api/spotify/artist-profile` (GET/POST)
- DynamoDB storage with `spotify-artist-profile` provider type
- UI component: `components/settings/spotify-artist-profile.tsx`
- Setup script: `scripts/setup-algoryx-profile.js`

## User Experience Flow

### Before Fix:
1. User connects Spotify → Wrong profile shows (personal name)
2. No way to configure correct artist profile
3. Hardcoded fallbacks mask the real issue

### After Fix:
1. User connects Spotify → System checks for stored artist profile
2. If no profile found → Shows setup prompt in Catalog
3. User clicks "Configure Artist Profile" → Goes to Settings
4. User sets up ALGORYX profile → Returns to Catalog
5. Correct tracks and artist info displayed

## Testing

**Test Script Created:** `test-artist-profile.js`
- Verifies API endpoints work correctly
- Tests profile storage and retrieval
- Can be run with: `npm run test-artist-profile`

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/spotify/artist-tracks/route.ts` - Removed hardcoded fallbacks
2. `app/dashboard/catalog/page.tsx` - Added setup prompt UI
3. `package.json` - Added test script
4. `test-artist-profile.js` - Created test script

## Next Steps

1. **Run the setup script** with your actual user ID:
   ```bash
   npm run setup-algoryx
   ```

2. **Test the implementation**:
   ```bash
   npm run test-artist-profile
   ```

3. **Verify in the UI**:
   - Go to Catalog page
   - Should see ALGORYX tracks instead of wrong profile
   - If setup needed, will see clear prompt

## Benefits

✅ **No more hardcoded values** - System is now dynamic and user-configurable
✅ **Clear user feedback** - Users know when and how to fix profile issues  
✅ **Proper error handling** - Meaningful errors instead of silent fallbacks
✅ **Scalable solution** - Works for any artist, not just ALGORYX
✅ **Better UX** - Guided setup process with clear instructions

The system now properly handles artist profile configuration without hardcoded fallbacks, providing a much better user experience for managing Spotify artist profiles.
