# Spotify Token Refresh Implementation

## Problem Solved
Your Spotify access token was expired, causing API calls to fail with 401 errors even though the artist profile (ALGORYX) was correctly retrieved.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Token Refresh Helper
**File: `lib/spotify-helpers.ts`**
- `getValidSpotifyToken()` function that:
  - Checks if token is expired or expiring soon (within 5 minutes)
  - Automatically refreshes the token using the refresh token
  - Updates the token in DynamoDB
  - Returns the valid access token

### 2. Updated API Endpoints
**Files Updated:**
- `app/api/spotify/artist-tracks/route.ts`
- `app/api/spotify/top-tracks/route.ts`

Both endpoints now:
- Use the `getValidSpotifyToken()` helper
- Automatically refresh expired tokens
- Log when tokens are refreshed

### 3. Created Manual Refresh Endpoint (Optional)
**File: `app/api/spotify/refresh-token/route.ts`**
- POST endpoint to manually refresh tokens if needed
- Can be called with `{ userId: "your-user-id" }`

## How It Works

1. When you load the Catalog page, it calls the Spotify APIs
2. The APIs check if your token is valid
3. If expired or expiring soon, they automatically refresh it
4. The new token is saved to DynamoDB
5. The API call proceeds with the fresh token

## Benefits

✅ **Automatic token refresh** - No more 401 errors
✅ **Proactive refresh** - Refreshes 5 minutes before expiry
✅ **Seamless experience** - Users don't notice the refresh
✅ **Persistent tokens** - New tokens saved to DynamoDB

## Testing

Simply refresh your Catalog page. The system will:
1. Find your ALGORYX profile ✅ (already working)
2. Refresh your expired token automatically
3. Load your ALGORYX tracks correctly

The logs will show:
```
Found stored artist profile: ALGORYX 7ibWrazAoXwtMpiwDlpZ9k
Refreshing expired Spotify token for user: 14287408-6011-70b3-5ac6-089f0cafdc10
Token was refreshed for user: 14287408-6011-70b3-5ac6-089f0cafdc10
```

Your ALGORYX tracks should now load successfully!
