# Fixes Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Agent Mode Functionality Restored**
- **Problem**: Agent simulation was triggering in Chat mode
- **Solution**: Added conditional check to only trigger agent simulation when `mode === "agent"`
- **Result**: Agent mode shows 18-second simulation with action buttons ("View Report", "Fix Metadata")

### 2. **Chat Mode with Real Bedrock Responses**
- **Problem**: Chat was returning hardcoded mock responses
- **Solution**: Created `BedrockClientDirect` that bypasses development mode restrictions
- **Result**: Chat now returns real AI-generated responses from AWS Bedrock

### 3. **Gmail Integration Working**
- **Problem**: 404 redirect after Gmail OAuth
- **Solution**: Fixed redirect URL to use `/dashboard/settings`
- **Result**: Gmail connects successfully and shows as connected in platform list

### 4. **Intelligent Email Analysis**
- **Problem**: Chat couldn't analyze emails
- **Solution**: Integrated Gmail API with Bedrock to provide email context
- **Result**: Chat can now analyze your actual Gmail emails and provide insights

## 🎯 How Everything Works Now

### **Agent Mode**
```
User message → 18-second simulation → Response with action buttons
```
- Shows progress animations
- Returns comprehensive analysis
- Provides action buttons: "View Report", "Fix Metadata"

### **Chat Mode**
```
User message → Check if email-related → Search Gmail (if needed) → 
Send to Bedrock with context → Real AI response
```
- No agent simulation
- Real Bedrock responses (not mock data)
- Automatically searches Gmail for relevant context
- Provides insights based on actual emails
