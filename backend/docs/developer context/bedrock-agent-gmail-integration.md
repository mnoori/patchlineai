# Bedrock Agent Gmail Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive information about integrating AWS Bedrock Agent with Gmail functionality for the Patchline project. The agent, named "Pathcy," helps musicians manage their email communications while maintaining context from their knowledge base.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **AWS Bedrock Agent**
   - Agent ID: Configured via `BEDROCK_AGENT_ID` environment variable
   - Agent Alias: Configured via `BEDROCK_AGENT_ALIAS_ID` (defaults to TSTALIASID for testing)
   - Model: Claude 3 Sonnet (anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0)

2. **Gmail Integration**
   - OAuth 2.0 authentication
   - Lambda functions for Gmail operations
   - DynamoDB for token storage

3. **Knowledge Base**
   - Stores chat history
   - Contains critical documents (contracts, legal docs)
   - Provides context for agent responses

### AWS Services Used

- **Amazon Bedrock**: Agent runtime and Claude model
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions for Gmail operations
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Token storage and session management
- **AWS IAM**: Permission management
- **Amazon S3**: Knowledge base document storage
- **Amazon OpenSearch**: Knowledge base vector search

## Lambda Functions

### 1. Gmail Authentication Handler (`gmail-auth-handler`)

**Purpose**: Handles OAuth callback and token storage

**Location**: `backend/lambda/gmail-auth-handler/index.py`

**Environment Variables**:
- `CLIENT_ID`: Gmail OAuth client ID
- `CLIENT_SECRET`: Gmail OAuth client secret
- `REDIRECT_URI`: OAuth callback URL
- `TABLE_NAME`: DynamoDB table for token storage

### 2. Gmail Action Handler (`gmail-action-handler`)

**Purpose**: Executes Gmail operations (read, search, draft, send)

**Location**: `backend/lambda/gmail-action-handler/index.py`

**Operations**:
- `/gmail/read`: Read recent emails
- `/gmail/search`: Search emails with query
- `/gmail/draft`: Create email draft
- `/gmail/send`: Send email

## Agent Configuration

### Creating the Bedrock Agent

1. **Navigate to Amazon Bedrock Console**
   - Go to AWS Console ‚Üí Amazon Bedrock ‚Üí Agents

2. **Create New Agent**
   - Name: `PatchlineGmailAgent`
   - Description: "AI assistant for musicians to manage emails and communications"
   - Model: Claude 3 Sonnet
   - Instructions: See "Agent Instructions" section below

3. **Configure Action Groups**
   - Action Group Name: `GmailActions`
   - Lambda Function: `gmail-action-handler`
   - API Schema: Upload the OpenAPI schema from `backend/lambda/gmail-openapi-schema.json`

4. **Create Knowledge Base**
   - Name: `PatchlineKnowledgeBase`
   - Data Source: S3 bucket for user documents
   - Embeddings Model: Titan Embeddings G1 - Text
   - Vector Database: Amazon OpenSearch Serverless

5. **Test and Deploy**
   - Create an alias for production use
   - Note the Agent ID and Alias ID for environment variables

Now let me check our current implementation status:
Could not find file 'backend/lambda/gmail-action-handler/index.py' in the workspace.
Great! Let me check the current implementation status:
Now let me check if we have the updated chat interface with proper logging:
I need to update the implementation. Let me provide a comprehensive status check and then update the necessary files:
Current Implementation Status
‚úÖ What's Ready:
Lambda Functions: Gmail auth and action handlers exist
OpenAPI Schema: Gmail actions schema is ready
Basic Chat Route: Bedrock Agent integration started
UI Components: Chat interface and sidebar exist
Documentation: Now created
‚ùå What Needs Updates:
Chat API Route: Missing proper logging and trace parsing
Chat Interface: Missing real agent log integration
Sidebar Component: Missing real agent event handling
Environment Variables: Need agent-specific configs
üîß Modularity Assessment:
YES, the implementation is highly modular! Here's why:
Separate Lambda Functions: Each service (Gmail, future Spotify, etc.) has its own handlers
Generic Agent Client: The Bedrock client can work with any agent
Configurable Action Groups: Each agent can have different action groups
Extensible Logging: The logging system works for any agent type
Environment-Based Config: Easy to add new agents with new env vars
Let me update the necessary files:

Now let me update the sidebar to handle real agent events:
Summary & Next Steps
 
## Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:

```env
# Bedrock Agent Configuration
BEDROCK_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id_here
BEDROCK_AGENT_ALIAS_ID=your_agent_alias_id_here

# AWS Configuration (if not already present)
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key

# Gmail OAuth (already configured)
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=your_gmail_client_id
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_gmail_client_secret
GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri
```

## Activity Logging

The agent provides real-time activity logs that appear in the UI. These logs are:

1. **Friendly and Musical**: Using music-related language and emojis
2. **Informative**: Showing actual progress of operations
3. **Contextual**: Reflecting the specific actions being performed

### Log Types

- **working**: Ongoing operations (blue spinner)
- **success**: Completed operations (green checkmark)
- **error**: Failed operations (red warning)
- **info**: General information (blue info icon)

### Example Logs

```javascript
{
  timestamp: "14:32:01",
  message: "üé§ Starting up... Let me check what I can do for you!",
  type: "working",
  icon: "‚ö°"
}
```

## API Integration

### Chat API Route (`/api/chat`)

The route handles both chat and agent modes:

**Chat Mode**: Direct responses without agent features
**Agent Mode**: Full agent capabilities with Gmail and knowledge base access

**Request**:
```json
{
  "message": "Check my emails about the record deal",
  "userId": "user123",
  "mode": "agent",
  "sessionId": "optional-session-id"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "response": "I found 3 emails about your record deal...",
  "sessionId": "user123-1234567890",
  "hasEmailContext": true,
  "actionsInvoked": ["/gmail/search"],
  "mode": "agent",
  "logs": [
    {
      "timestamp": "14:32:01",
      "message": "üé§ Starting up... Let me check what I can do for you!",
      "type": "working",
      "icon": "‚ö°"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Modular Design

### Adding New Agents

The implementation is designed to be modular and extensible:

1. **Agent Configuration**
   - Each agent has its own environment variables
   - Separate action groups for different functionalities
   - Independent knowledge bases

2. **Lambda Functions**
   - Reusable action handler pattern
   - Standardized OpenAPI schemas
   - Common authentication mechanisms

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Generic agent activity logging system
   - Configurable agent modes
   - Extensible UI components

### Example: Adding a Spotify Agent

```env
# New agent configuration
SPOTIFY_AGENT_ID=your_spotify_agent_id
SPOTIFY_AGENT_ALIAS_ID=your_spotify_agent_alias

# Reuse existing patterns
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
```

## Testing

### 1. Test Gmail Integration
```bash
node test-gmail-integration.js
```

### 2. Test Chat with Gmail Context
```bash
node test-chat-gmail.js
```

### 3. Manual Testing
1. Switch to Agent mode in the UI
2. Ask about emails: "Show me emails about contracts"
3. Watch the activity logs appear
4. Verify the response includes email context

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent Not Found**
   - Verify `BEDROCK_AGENT_ID` is set correctly
   - Ensure the agent is deployed with an alias

2. **No Gmail Access**
   - Check Lambda function permissions
   - Verify Gmail tokens in DynamoDB
   - Ensure OAuth flow completed successfully

3. **No Activity Logs**
   - Verify `enableTrace: true` in agent invocation
   - Check browser console for events
   - Ensure UI event listeners are registered

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:
```javascript
// In app/api/chat/route.ts
console.log('Traces:', JSON.stringify(traces, null, 2))
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Storage**: All OAuth tokens encrypted in DynamoDB
2. **User Isolation**: Each user's data strictly separated
3. **Permission Scoping**: Minimal Gmail permissions requested
4. **Audit Logging**: All agent actions logged for compliance
5. **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate retention policies

## Next Steps

1. Create the Bedrock Agent in AWS Console
2. Deploy Lambda functions
3. Configure environment variables
4. Test the integration
5. Deploy to production

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check AWS CloudWatch logs for Lambda functions
2. Review Bedrock Agent traces in the console
3. Enable debug logging in the application
4. Contact the development team with specific error messages
