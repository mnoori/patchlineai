- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling that enables rapid feature development

## Current Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (React-based framework for server-rendered applications)
- **UI Library**: Custom design system built on shadcn/ui components
- **Hosting**: AWS Amplify with global CDN distribution
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito user pools with secure email/password authentication
- **State Management**: React hooks and context for efficient data flow
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling

### Backend Architecture 

- **API Layer**: Fastify-based Node.js server with TypeScript
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK for infrastructure-as-code deployment
- **Compute**: AWS Fargate for containerized, serverless compute
- **Networking**: Application Load Balancer with auto-scaling
